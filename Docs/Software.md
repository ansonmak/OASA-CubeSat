# Software Tutorial

## 1. Install Arduino IDE
Visit https://www.arduino.cc/en/software to download and install Arduino IDE software on your computer.

## 2. Install ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE
After you have installed Arduino IDE on your computer, you will need to install the ESP32 board library in Arduino IDE before uploading code to the ESP32 board. 

**2.1** Launch Arduino IDE and go to **Files** > **Preferences**.

## 4. Upload Code to ESP32-CAM
**4.1** Open the file [`ESP32-CAM.ino`](../Software/ESP32-CAM/ESP32-CAM.ino) in the folder [`Software/ESP32-CAM`](../Software/ESP32-CAM/) with Arduino IDE.

**4.2** Turn off the CubeSat by pushing the lever of power switch upward and turn the CubeSat into **upload mode** by sliding the switch to the side of **Upload**.

**4.3** Plug in the mini USB wire to the ESP32 Programmer (Red Module) and connect to your PC.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/4.3.jpg" width="300">

**4.4** In your Arduino IDE, go to **Tools** > **Board** > **esp32** > select **ESP32 Wrover Module**.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/4.4.png" width="800">

**4.5** In **Tools**, select the upload configuration as follows:
- **Port**: COMX (Try different COM port one by one if multiple COM ports appear)
- **Core Debug Level**: None
- **Flash Frequency**: 80MHz
- **Flash Mode**: QIO
- **Partition Scheme**: Huge App (3MB No OTA)
- **Upload Speed**: 921600

**4.6** Click the **Upload** arrow icon on the top left corner to start compile and upload the code to ESP32-CAM.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/4.6.png" width="500">

During uploading, the message ***"Writing at 0x00000000... (xx%)"*** will be shown up in the **Output** window at the botton of Arduino IDE.  
***Please do not unplug the USB wire during this process.***

If the message ***"Leaving... Hard resetting via RIS Pin..."*** shows up, the upload is completed and the Mini USB wire can be unplugged.

**4.7** Switch the CubeSat back to **Program Mode** for running the uploaded program.

## 5. Upload Code to Arduino Nano
**5.1** Plug the Mini USB connected to your PC to Arduino Nano.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/5.1.jpg" width="300">

**5.2** In **Tools** > **Board** > **Arduino AVR Boards** > select **Arduino Nano**.  
In  **Tools** > **Processor** > select **ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)**.  (If the upload failed, try different processor since the processor varies across different manufracturers.)

<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/5.2b.png" height="300">

**5.3** Click the **Upload** arrow icon on the top left corner to start compile and upload the code.  
If completed, the message ***"Done Uploading"***  will be shown and the Mini USB wire can be unplugged.

## 6. Power the CubeSat and Connect to WiFi
**6.1** Turn on the power switch by pushing the lever downward.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/6.1.jpg" height="400">

**6.2** The message ***"Searching WiFi..."*** will be shown on the OLED diplay and the ESP32-CAM will search for the saved WiFi credentials in the board, which is the SSID and the password of a hotspot.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/6.2.jpg" width="500">

**6.3** If the LED on the ESP32-CAM will flash multiple times, the ESP32-CAM is connected to the WiFi network and its IP adress will be shown on the display.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/6.3.jpg" width="500">  
If the message ***"SSID not found. Entered config mode."*** is shown on the display, the ESP32-CAM cannot found its saved WiFi network. See ***Sec. 6.5*** for changing its WiFi configurations.

**6.4** Connect your device (PC, laptop, mobile phone, or tablet) to the same WiFi network that the CubeSat is connected to. Open the browser and search with the IP address. A web page of CubeSat's control panel will be shown.  Go to ***Sec. 7*** to see how to control the CubeSat.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/6.4.jpg" width="400">

**6.5** If the saved WiFi credentials is not found, the CubeSat will turn into **Config mode** and display its SSID name on the OLED display.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/6.5.jpg" width="500">

**6.6** Use any device with WiFi connectivity to search SSID name of the CubeSat.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/6.6.jpg" height="500">

**6.7** After your device is connected to the CubeSat through the SSID, the **WiFi Manager** page will show up on your device. Click **configure WiFi** > select the WiFi network that you want your CubeSat to connect or type the SSID and password in the box below.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/6.7a.jpg" width="400">
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/6.7b.jpg" width="400">

**6.8** Click save and close the **WiFi Manager** page on your device. Turn off power of your CubeSat and turn on again to reset. Repeat ***Sec. 6.1*** to try the new WiFi connection.

**6.9** If you want to erase the saved WiFi credentials to reconfigure the WiFi settings, you can press the button next to ESP32-CAM while turning on the CubeSat. This can force the ESP32-CAM entering the **Config mode**.

## 7. Control the CubeSat Remotely with the Control Panel
After the successful WiFi connection, a control panel shown below can be access by searching the CubeSat's IP address on the browser.

**7.1** **Camera Live Stream**  
Press the green **Start Stream** button to start the video stream. Press the red **Rotate Stream** button to rotate the video image if the orientation is wrong. The two sliding bar below are used to increase video resolution and video quilty.

**7.2** **Solar Panel Deploy**  
The **Deploy** button is used to release the spring-loaded solar panels by activating the solenoids. 

**7.3** **Reaction Wheel Control**  
The third sliding bar is used to control the motor coupled to the reaction wheel. Drag the slider to control the motor rotate left and right. Press the **Stop Motor** button below to stop the motor.

**7.4** **Light Sensor Readings**  
The CubeSat has four ports to install the light sensors. They are located at the left and right sides after the solar panels deployed.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/7.4a.jpg" width="400">  
After plugging the light sensors to the ports, the readings will be shown on the control panel.  
<img src="../Figures/Software_Tutorial/7.4b.jpg" width="600">  

**7.5** **Battery Meter**  
The top left green bar is the battery meter. Charge the battery if the percentage below 20%. The battery can be charged by plugging the mini USB wire to the charging module and connect the USB wire to any 5V power supply. The charging time would take around 20-30 mins.

**7.6** **CubeSat LED Flash**  
The **Flash LED** button will flash the LED located on the ESP32-CAM.

**7.7** **Auto Light Tracking**  
The **Light Tracking** button will turn on an auto light tracking mode by comparing the light sensors values located at the left and right side. The CubeSat will rotate the reaction wheel to change its orientation for facing its solar panels to the brightest direction.
